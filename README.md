*Cue Game of Thrones Music*

Humanity needs your help! Two armies have assembled for an epic battle. On one side you have the Northern Army led by
Jon Snow and Queen Daenerys Targaryen. They have an army of fierce wildings, northern soldiers, Dothraki warriors and a
fire breathing dragon! However, the Night King is a fearsome opponent with a White Walker army, who have a higher
strength level than humans, and lightning breathing dragon (eek!)

Be warned, when a member of the Northern Army dies, they become a part of the Night King’s forces. It's up to you to
defeat this foe using the following tactics:

Valyrian Steel Stab
-10 points
Drogon Attack
-100 points
Flaming Arrows
-15 points
Wolf Attack
-20 points

If humanity depletes the undead’s army enough, they can end the war by deploying an Arya Stark attack.

If you would rather fight for the Night Kings Army… do you! The White Walkers have less attack methods, but higher power
and strength and each dead northerner becomes a part of your army. Use the following attacks to extinguish the
humanity’s flame:



White Walker Attack
-20 points
Viserion Attack
-100 points
Knight King
-50 points
